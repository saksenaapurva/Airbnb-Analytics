AirBnb is the largest peer-to-peer network that enables users to rent out their properties to travellers in their locale. 
One of the distinguishing features for AirBnB has been its economic pricing. 
However, that was also one of the biggest question marks for its hosts and users. 
Hosts want to quote a price that attracts maximum customers, is competitive with other listings and reaps good profits.
Quoting a higher price might lead to reduced bookings whereas quoting a lower price might hinder profits. 
Customers want a way to ensure that they are being charged fairly. 
In this project, I designed a price prediction model that can help to avoid the problems of overpricing and underpricing by analyzing various factors that impact price of a listing. 
The model aims to provide an ideal price for an AirBnB listing considering various factors like neighbourhood, accommodation, and amenities like number of beds, bedrooms etc.
As part of the build process, I used a kaggle dataset and applied multiple linear regression to predict prices based on a variety of predictors.
